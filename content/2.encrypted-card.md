Have you ever wondered if you could encrypt a business card? Me neither, yet I have done it.

<!--more-->
## _Wait what?_
Ok, fair question.

First, you need to know about those NFC or QRCode business cards like [MyEverCard](https://myevercard.com/) for example. I met someone at business show who had one like this made of wood, and they hit the back of my phone with it. It asked me if I wanted to open the link, and from there I could import the contact directly.

The idea is to have a business card with minimal info printed on it, and your contact info is actually retrievable by opening a link contained within the QRCode or the RFID tag.

The idea seems fun, but I would rather not rely on an external service to store my contact info, which is easy: QRCodes and RFID tags can contain arbitrary links!

I could just store my bare contact info onto a webpage, but I don't want a search engine to index this webpage, otherwise my phone number would be publicly accessible.

Two options:
- either I host a web server that returns the contact info only if authenticated with a token contained in the link, but I don't want ot host a web server...
- or encrypt the data, deploy it on a static web server, and decrypt it in the browser.

If you know my love for server management (which is only matched by my love for mosquito bites), you can deduce that I chose the option where I encrypt my business card.

## How does it work?
The general idea is:
1. encrypt the confidential contact information locally with a secret key.
2. upload the encrypted data onto a static hosting (like Github Pages).
3. retrieve and decrypt it from my contact's browser.

    subgraph My PC
        B[Encryption key] --> C
        A[Confidential contact info] --> C((Encrypt))
        C --> D[Encrypted contact info]
    end
    subgraph GitHub
        D --> G[Encrypted contact info]
    end
    subgraph My contact's computer
        G --> K[Encrypted contact info]
        K --> L((Decrypt))
        L --> M[Confidential contact info]
    end
        B -.->L
</Mermaid>

The challenges with this are:
1. How to execute code onto my contact's computer to decrypt stuff? With [client-side decryption](#client-side-decryption).
2. How to send the encryption key over to my contact without hosting it? With a trick that [uses a URI fragment](#using-the-uri-fragment).
3. How do I allow my contact to import a vCard directly onto their phone? With [`vcard-creator`](https://github.com/joaocarmo/vcard-creator).

### Known limits
The attacks I knowingly don't care about here are:
1. GitHub injecting code into the website that could exfiltrate data out of the webpage once decrypted.
2. A contact's computer being hacked, which coud leak the confidential data and the secret key.
3. A contact leaking the secret key on purpose.

**Disclaimer:** the most sensitive piece of data protected with this is my phone number, and to be honest, I'm pretty sure it is already publicly accessible.

## Client-side decryption
The first issue is straightforward: browsers execute code when loading a website, why not decrypt stuff with it?

By the way, I literally built my company [Seald](https://www.seald.io) out of this idea.

### Encryption step
The [`encryptAssets.js`](https://github.com/tex0l/tex0l.github.io/blob/main/encryptAssets.js) is executed locally and does the following:
1. Generates a 16 bytes salt if there is none, and puts it encoded in base 64 in `/public/salt`.
2. Derives a 32 bytes key with [SCrypt](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt) from the salt & password (given through the `PASSWORD` environment variable).
3. Encrypts all files in a directory named `public_to_encrypt` (which is not uploaded to the repository as it is in the `.gitignore`) with [AES-GCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode) and a random 12 bytes IV.
4. Puts the encrypted version in the [`public/encrypted/`](https://github.com/tex0l/tex0l.github.io/tree/main/public/encrypted) which are served statically.

In order for my contact to decrypt the data, they only need to know the password I used to derive the key (we'll see how to do that in the next part).

Note that I could very well avoid the key derivation and use a raw 32 bytes key instead which would be more secure, but I want the key to be "readable" like: `doorknob-rejoicing-strength-whole-simple`.

Also note that AES-GCM is probably not the best algorithm for this purpose as it is limited in how much data I can encrypt with a {key + IV} (about 4Go), and since I use a random IV, I cannot encrypt more than 2^32 times otherwise an attacker could [do that](https://twitter.com/angealbertini/status/425561082841690112).

### Decryption step
The decryption step is straightforward, we just have to do the same thing but in a browser, and instead of encrypting we just have to decrypt.

The implementation is done using [SubtleCrypto](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto), [`scrypt-js`](https://github.com/ricmoo/scrypt-js) and [`buffer`](https://github.com/feross/buffer).

Once decrypted:
1. If the file is a JSON, `JSON.parse` is used and the content used within the webpage.
2. If the file is an image, I can then display the image using [`URL.createObjectURL`](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL), which is done automatically with the [EncryptedImage](https://github.com/tex0l/tex0l.github.io/blob/main/components/EncryptedImage.client.vue) component I made.

## Using the URI Fragment
Now that we understand how to encrypt, decrypt & display, how to securely exchange the password?

We need something that's contained in the URL, accessible by the Javascript context but that is not sent over to the server in the HTTP request.

One idea could be to put the password in a query parameter (used for example for [S3 pre-signed URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-creating-signed-url-canned-policy.html)), but query parameters are sent to the server in the HTTP request.

The trick is to use the [URI fragment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/hash). It is normally used by the browser to scroll to the node whose `id` is the content of the URI fragment, but if we ignore this, the URI fragment is a string which is:
- contained in the link;
- available in the Javascript context;
- not sent over to the server.

For example, if I open this webpage: `https://tex0l.github.io/encrypted-card-dummy#my-super-secret-password`, it makes a GET request to `https://tex0l.github.io/encrypted-card` and the Javascript context can just read `window.location.hash` to retrieve `'#my-super-secret-password'` without it being accessible to the server.

That's exactly what I do.

## Conclusion
Ok, so I can't give you my actual password, that would defeat the purpose, you can try to brute force the password there though: [`https://tex0l.github.io/encrypted-card`](https://tex0l.github.io/encrypted-card).

However, here is a sanitized version: [https://tex0l.github.io/encrypted-card-dummy#my-super-secret-password](/encrypted-card-dummy#my-super-secret-password)

Now I have to order NFC business cards so that project can actually be at least a bit useful...
