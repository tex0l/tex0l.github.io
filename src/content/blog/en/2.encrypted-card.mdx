You may have already seen these reusable business cards which are not distributed, but scanned (by QRCode or NFC), and which allow the contact details to be downloaded directly (like [MyEverCard](https://myevercard.com/)).

Usually, these cards simply contain a link to a (paying) website, and the holder can update his or her contact details there. The problem is that this site holds the details of all its users in the clear, and I don't feel like sharing mine (or paying a subscription).

The aim of this article is to make an alternative to this kind of services, but with a link pointing to a static site (the blog you're reading), while preventing access to the data when simply browsing the website.

TLDR: I explain how I coded an encrypted business card <Icon name="noto:man-shrugging" class="inline w-6"/>.

## How does it work?
The principle is as follows:
1. encrypt confidential contact data locally with a secret key.
2. store the encrypted data on a static server (such as Github Pages).
3. generate a link to the static server containing the secret key in the URL hash.
4. retrieve and decrypt this data client-side from the browser of the person opening the link.
5. display the contact data and download the contact form.

        B --> C
        A --> C
        C --> D
    }

    rectangle "GitHub" {
        [Encrypted contact info] as G
        D --> G
    }

    rectangle "Business card" {
        [tex0l.github.io\/en\/encrypted-card\/#key] as KEY
    }

    rectangle "My contact's browser" {
        [Encrypted contact info] as K
        [Key] as KEYBROWSER
        [Decryption] as L
        [Contact info] as M
        [Display] as N
        [vCard] as O
        KEYBROWSER --> L
        G --> K
        K --> L
        L --> M
        M --> N
        M --> O
    }

        B --> KEY
        KEY --> KEYBROWSER

In fact, I literally created my company [Seald](https://www.seald.io) around the idea of client-side encryption in web and mobile applications.

### Known limits
The most sensitive piece of data I want to protect with this project is my phone number, which is certainly already publicly accessible online given the number of sales calls I receive, so I'm not looking to fulfill any real security objectives.

In particular, the attacks I'm deliberately ignoring are:
1. GitHub injecting code into the static site, which could then exfiltrate the data once encrypted.
2. The connection to GitHub, which could be compromised to alter the static site's code.
3. My contact's computer or browser could be compromised, which would compromise contact data and the secret key.
4. A contact willingly or unwillingly sharing the link or secret key.

## Encryption
First of all, I need to encrypt the data on my PC: `contactInfo.json` and `profilePicture.jpg` which are placed in the `publicToEncrypt` folder of the project (which is in the `.gitignore` to avoid publishing it unencrypted in the code repository).

To do this, I need to :
- [derive a key from a password](#derive-the-password).
- [encrypt each file with this key](#encrypt-a-file).
- add the encrypted files to the code repository so that they can be accessed from the path `/encrypted/{filename}.encrypted`.

### Derive the password
Handling 32 random bytes encoded in base64 in a URL isn't practical, so I preferred to use a password.

To derive a 32-byte key from this password, I use the `scrypt` derivation function and a random salt statically accessible in a file [`/salt.txt`](/salt.txt).

```typescript
import { scrypt } from 'node:crypto'
import { promisify } from 'node:util'
import { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises'
import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer'

const scryptAsync = promisify(scrypt)
const N = 1024, r = 8, p = 1
const dkLen = 32

const normalizePassword = (password: string): Buffer => Buffer.from(password.normalize('NFKC'), 'utf8')

const deriveKey = async (password: Buffer, salt: Buffer): Promise<Buffer> => scryptAsync(password, salt, dkLen, { N, r, p })

const salt = Buffer.from(await readFile('./public/salt.txt'), 'base64')
const password = normalizePassword(process.env.PASSWORD)
const key = await deriveKey(password, salt)
```

### Encrypt a file
To encrypt a file with a given `key`, I use AES-GCM and a random 12-byte nonce :

```typescript
import type { Cipher } from 'node:crypto'
import type { Buffer } from 'node:buffer'
import { createCipheriv, randomBytes } from 'node:crypto'

// This function is call by `encryptDir` for each file to encrypt
const encryptFile = async (data: Buffer, key: Buffer): Buffer => {
  const nonce: Buffer = randomBytes(12)
  const cipher: Cipher  = createCipheriv('aes-256-gcm', key, nonce)
  const encryptedData: Buffer = Buffer.concat([cipher.update(data), cipher.final()])
  const authTag: Buffer = cipher.getAuthTag()

  return Buffer.concat([nonce, encryptedData, authTag])
}
```

:::note
The GCM mode chosen for AES requires :
- that the nonce is not random, but "unique", and random is not considered unique in cryptography (see [the article I wrote on Seald's blog](https://www.seald.io/blog/3-common-mistakes-when-implementing-encryption#iv-generation)).
- that the message does not exceed 64GB, otherwise it exceeds the counter used by AES-CTR (used internally by AES-GCM).

In my case :
- I accept to use a random nonce as long as the number of encrypted files is very low, well below the 6 billion beyond which the nonce would no longer be "unique".
- I don't encrypt files larger than 64GB.
:::

After running this function on `profilePicture.jpg` and `contactInfo.json` (not published on the code repository), two encrypted files are produced and added to the code repository: `profilePicture.jpg.encrypted` and `contactInfo.json.encrypted`.

## Sharing the password
To share the password, I use the [URL hash](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/hash) which is what's after the `#` in a URL. Normally, this is used to automatically scroll to an anchor in the page. But the URL hash has the property of not being transmitted in the network request; it remains exclusively within the Javascript context of the page.

It is therefore possible to use this URL hash to transfer a secret in a URL to the Javascript context without the hosting server ever having access to it.

> https://tex0l.github.io/fr/encrypted-card-dummy/#my-super-secret-password

Once the page has been opened, this password can be retrieved from the page as follows:

```typescript
const password = window.location.hash.substring(1) // first character is `#`
```

## Decryption
Decryption is a two-step process:
- derive the password into the key.
- decrypt the files with the key.

### Deriving the password (bis)
To derive the password in the browser, we proceed in the same way as in our initial script, except that the standard Node.js library is not available.

We therefore use the [`scrypt-js`](https://github.com/ricmoo/scrypt-js) library to perform the derivation, [`buffer`](https://github.com/feross/buffer) to have a polyfill of `Buffer` in the browser, and we import the resulting key as `CryptoKey` from [SubtleCrypto](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto):

```typescript
import { Buffer } from 'buffer'
import { scrypt } from 'scrypt-js'

const normalizePassword = (password: string): Buffer => Buffer.from(password.normalize('NFKC'), 'utf8')

const N = 1024, r = 8, p = 1
const dkLen = 32

const deriveKey = async (password:string, salt:Buffer): Promise<CryptoKey> =>
  self.crypto.subtle.importKey(
    'raw',
    await scrypt(normalizePassword(password), salt, N, r, p, dkLen),
    { name: 'AES-GCM' },
    false,
    ['decrypt']
  )

const salt = await (await window.fetch('/salt.txt')).text() // the salt is publicly available

const key = await deriveKey(password, Buffer.from(salt, 'base64'))
```

### Decrypt a file
We continue the operation by decrypting `encryptedContactInfo.json.encrypted` and `profilePicture.jpg.encrypted`.

```typescript
const decrypt = async (data: Uint8Array, key: CryptoKey): Promise<ArrayBuffer> => {
  const nonce = data.slice(0, 12)
  const ciphertext = data.slice(12)

  return self.crypto.subtle.decrypt(
    {
      name: 'AES-GCM',
      iv: nonce
    },
    key,
    ciphertext
  )
}

const encryptedContactInfo = await (await window.fetch('/encrypted/contactInfo.json.encrypted')).arrayBuffer()
const encryptedProfilePicture = await (await window.fetch('/encrypted/profilePicture.jpg.encrypted')).arrayBuffer()

const decryptedContactInfo = await decrypt(encryptedContactInfo, key)
const decryptedProfilePicture = await decrypt(encryptedProfilePicture, key)
```

These raw versions of the decrypted data we have in `Blob` form are used in the context of the webpage as follows:

```typescript
import { Buffer } from 'buffer'
const contactInfo = JSON.parse(Buffer.from(decryptedContactInfo).toString('utf-8'))
// {
//   "firstName": "John",
//   "lastName": "Doe",
//   "emailAddress": "john@doe.org",
//   "phoneNumber": "+1 234 567 890",
//   "linkedin": "jdoe",
//   "twitter": "@DoeJ",
//   "jobTitle": "Dummy job",
//   "companyName": "Dummy company",
//   "companyLink": "https://www.doe.org",
//   "emailAddressLink": "mailto:john@doe.org",
//   "phoneNumberLink": "tel:+1234567890",
//   "twitterLink": "https://twitter.com/DoeJ",
//   "linkedinLink": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdoe/",
//   "personalWebsiteLink": "https://www.doe.org"
// }

const blobURL = URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([decryptedProfilePicture]))
// blob:https://tex0l.github.io/95ef5165-ccb6-41c4-8157-5ec943509e46
```

### Downloading a contact file
To generate the contact file, I use the [`vcard-creator`](https://github.com/joaocarmo/vcard-creator) package, and generate it on the fly on click and download it programmatically:

```typescript
import vCard from 'vcard-creator'
const card = new vCard()
const text = card
    .addName(contactInfo.lastName, contactInfo.firstName)
    .addCompany(contactInfo.companyName)
    .addJobtitle(contactInfo.jobTitle)
    .addEmail(contactInfo.emailAddress)
    .addPhoneNumber(contactInfo.phoneNumber)
    .addSocial(contactInfo.twitterLink, 'Twitter', contactInfo.twitter)
    .addSocial(contactInfo.linkedinLink, 'LinkedIn', contactInfo.linkedin)
    .addURL(contactInfo.personalWebsiteLink)
    .addURL(contactInfo.companyLink)
    .addPhoto(Buffer.from(decryptedProfilePicture).toString('base64'), 'JPEG')
    .buildVCard()

const blob = new Blob([text], { type: 'text/vcard' })

const a = document.createElement('a')
a.download = `${contactInfo.firstName}-${contactInfo.lastName}.vcard`
a.href = URL.createObjectURL(blob)
a.dataset.downloadurl = ['text/vcard', a.download, a.href].join(':')
a.style.display = 'none'
document.body.appendChild(a)
a.click()
document.body.removeChild(a)
setTimeout(function () { URL.revokeObjectURL(a.href) }, 1500)
```

For the rest, the piping is done in Vue.js for ease of use, but it doesn't matter. If you'd like to take a look at the source code, it differs slightly from the snippets above, which I've simplified.

## Conclusion
I can't give you the real password, that would be stupid (you can try brute-forcing it on this page [`https://tex0l.github.io/en/encrypted-card/`](/en/encrypted-card/), if you succeed, don't hesitate to tell me <Icon name="noto:winking-face" class="inline w-6"/>).

However, here's a "dummy" version you can try: [https://tex0l.github.io/en/encrypted-card-dummy/#my-super-secret-password](/en/encrypted-card-dummy/#my-super-secret-password). This dummy version uses:
- `my-super-secret-password` as the password.
- [`/saltDummy.txt`](/saltDummy.txt) as the salt.
- [`/encryptedDummy/contactInfo.json.encrypted`](/encryptedDummy/contactInfo.json.encrypted) as the encrypted contact info.
- [`/encryptedDummy/stock-portrait.png.encrypted`](/encryptedDummy/stock-portrait.png.encrypted) as the encrypted photo.

Now I need to order some NFC business cards to make this project even remotely useful...
