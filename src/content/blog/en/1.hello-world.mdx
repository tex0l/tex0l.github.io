Why would I create a blog? Honestly as I'm writing this article, I'm asking myself the same question...

## Why this blog?
If you know me, you know that I like to give my opinion on just about anything.
I actually don't like this character trait as I tend to draw conclusions too quickly, even without knowing too much about the topic of the discussion.

Also, my soon-to-be wife is a bit tired of my ranting about the news every evening.

The goal of this blog is to have a medium to express myself that won't annoy her <Icon name="emojione:winking-face" class="inline w-6"/>, and that will force me to make some research about the topics I cover, hopefully preventing me from being too peremptory.

## What to expect?
Not much.

Basically, whenever there's a topic I find interesting, I will try to write an article about it with as many sources as possible so that I am confident enough to publish it.

Feel free to contact me if you don't agree with me! I'm open to changing my mind.

## Why not use social media like anyone else?
I don't think social media are the right tool for me to make this blog: the main goal of this endeavour is not so much to share my opinion, but to form it, whereas social media's main goal are to share it.

## Why not use Medium then?
For fun mainly. I am a geek, and I very much like making things myself, and I wanted to build my blog myself. It may not be as shiny, but I made it.

## How does it work?
I decided to use:
- [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/v3) in order to be able to have build a static website.
- [`@nuxt/content`](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) so that I can write the articles in Markdown.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the styling.

It is deployed over [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/actions/deploy-pages/).
