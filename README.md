# tex0l.github.io

My personal website and blog, hosted on GitHub Pages. Yes, another developer with a blog they'll probably abandon after 3 posts.

## What's inside

- A landing page (because every developer needs one)
- An "About me" page where I pretend to be interesting
- A bilingual blog (FR/EN) about tech, cybersecurity, and whatever crosses my mind
- An end-to-end encrypted business card (because why make things simple when you can over-engineer them?)

## Tech stack

- **[Astro 5](https://astro.build)** — Static site generator
- **[Vue 3](https://vuejs.org)** — For the interactive bits
- **[Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com)** — Because writing actual CSS is so 2015
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)** — Strict mode, obviously

Fully static (no SSR), supports French and English.

## Development

```bash
npm install     # Install dependencies
npm run dev     # Dev server (localhost:4321)
